## Introduction

The goal of the project is to create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly.

```{r}
# Loading required package
r = getOption("repos")
r["CRAN"] = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"
options(repos = r)
install.packages("plotly")

install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)
```

```{r}

plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
